\arguments{
\item{title}{For \code{new_project()}, \code{new_idea()}, and
  \code{edit_project()}, the title of the project.

  For the \code{new_author()} and \code{edit_author()}, the job title of the
  author.}

\item{current_owner, corresp_auth, creator, lead}{An \code{id} or unambiguous
  \code{last_name}/\code{given_names} of one of the authors in the
  \code{\link{authors}()} table, which will be coerced into a
  \link{projects_author-class} object.

  If \code{corresp_auth} is specified, this author's contact information will
  be especially included in the output of \code{\link{header}()}.

  If \code{creator} is left blank, the numeric portion of the resulting
  \link{projects_author-class} object will be \code{0:}, followed by the
  value of \code{\link{Sys.info}()["user"]} (e.g., \code{0: user_j_smith}).}

\item{stage}{A number or string that will partially match exactly one of
  \code{c("1: design", "2: data collection", "3: analysis", "4: manuscript",
  "5: under review", "6: accepted", "0: ideas")}, communicating the stage the
  project is in. This will be coerced to be a character vector of class
  \code{projects_stage}.

  For \code{new_project()}, defaults to \code{"1: design"}.

  See \link{projects_stage-class}.}

\item{impact}{A scalar numeric value, intended to communicate the estimated
impact the project will have.}

\item{status}{A free text field, intended to communicate the most current
  condition the project or task is in.

  For \code{new_project()}, default is \code{"just created"}. For
  \code{new_idea()}, default is \code{"just an idea"}. For \code{new_task()},
  the default is \code{NA}.}

\item{short_title}{A nickname for the project. Can be used in other
\code{projects} package functions whenever needing to specify a project.}

\item{authors, affiliations}{For \code{new_project()}/\code{new_author()}, a
  vector of \code{id}s or unambiguous \code{given_names}/\code{last_name} or
  \code{department_name}/\code{institution_name} of authors/affiliations.
  Order will be preserved.

  For \code{edit_project()}/\code{edit_author()}, a formula specifying
  authors/affiliations to add or remove from the project/author. Formulas
  must have no left-hand side (i.e., begin with \code{\link{~}}) and use
  \code{+} to add and \code{-} to remove (see \link{formula}).

  Authors and affiliations may be specified by \code{id} or name. Each
  element must match an existing row in the
  \code{\link{authors}()}/\code{\link{affiliations}()} table.}

\item{deadline_type}{A free text field, intended to communicate the meaning
of the next field, \code{deadline}.}

\item{deadline}{A \code{\link{POSIXct}} object or something coercible to one
(via \code{lubridate::\link[lubridate]{as_datetime}()}).}

\item{id}{An integer that will become the item's permanent identification
number. Must be in the range 1-9999 or left blank. If left blank, the
lowest available integer in the aforementioned range will be selected.}

\item{folder_name}{A character string that can serve as a valid directory
name. By default, it is "p" followed by the project \code{id} number
left-filled with "0" until the number is four digits long.}

\item{parent_directory}{A character string that can be read as a file path.
  Can be either:

  \enumerate{

  \item the \emph{absolute} path of the \link[=projects_folder]{projects
  folder} (i.e., the value of \code{\link{projects_folder}()}, which is the
  default)

  \item an \emph{absolute} path pointing to a subfolder within the
  \link[=projects_folder]{projects folder}

  \item a \emph{relative} path (leading \code{"."} optional) that will be
  appended onto the end of the value of \code{\link{projects_folder}()}.

  }

  In any case, the result is that the new project folder will be a
  subdirectory of the main \link[=projects_folder]{projects folder}. See also
  \code{\link{setup_projects}()}.}

\item{make_directories}{Logical, indicating whether or not
\code{new_project()} should create subdirectories specified in the
\code{path} argument that do not already exist. Ignored if \code{path} is
left as the default or if all directories in \code{path} already exist.}

\item{template_folder}{A character string naming a folder in the
\emph{.templates} folder that will be copied into the
\link[=projects_folder]{projects folder} as the new project folder, renamed
according to the value of the \code{folder_name} argument. See also
\strong{Details} below.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{new_project()}}

\item{project, author, affiliation}{The \code{id} or unambiguous name(s) of a
project/author/affiliation to \code{new_task()} or \code{edit_*()} or
\code{delete_*()}.}

\item{task}{The name / very short description of the task.}

\item{TID}{The "\strong{t}ask \strong{ID}." \code{TID}s are always
  standardized so that for each project they are positive integers starting
  with 1.

  For \code{new_task()}, this is used to specify the \code{TID} of the new
  task. The user can enter any scalar, non-missing numeric value, and all
  tasks' \code{TID}s will be standardized. Therefore, the default of
  \code{Inf} for a new task always places the new task at the end of the
  list. If the new task's \code{TID} is the same as an existing task's
  \code{TID}, the new task will take priority.

  For \code{edit_task()} and \code{delete_task()}, this argument, along with
  the \code{project} argument, identifies the task to be edited or deleted.}

\item{effort, timing}{Any scalar numeric value, intended to communicate the
level of effort the task will require and the nature of the timing of the
task, respectively.}

\item{done}{Used to indicate whether or not the task has been completed. Must
be \code{0}, \code{1}, or \code{NA}.}

\item{archived}{Logical indicating whether or not the function should
  consider archived projects when determining which project the user is
  referring to in the \code{project} argument. \code{FALSE} by default.

  See the \strong{Details} section of \code{\link{archive_project}()} for
  more information on the "archived" status of a project.}

\item{given_names, last_name, department_name, institution_name}{Each a single
character string. Can be used whenever needing to specify a specific
author/affiliation.}

\item{degree}{A character string (preferably an abbreviation) denoting the
author's academic degree(s). Will be written next to author names when
\code{\link{header}()} is run.}

\item{email, phone}{A character string denoting the email/phone of the author.
Email will be coerced to lowercase. When a project is given a
\code{corresp_auth}, \code{email} will be included in "Corresponding
author:" section written by \code{\link{header}()}.}

\item{address}{A character string indicating the address of the affiliation.}

\item{new_TID}{Used to change the task ID of the task specified by
\code{project} and \code{TID}. The user can enter a scalar, non-missing
numeric value, and the \code{TID}s of all the project's tasks' will be
re-standardized (see the description of the \code{TID} argument above). The
task's TID will be unchanged if \code{new_TID} is left as the default
(\code{NULL}).}
}
\value{
\code{new_affiliation()} and \code{edit_affiliation()} simply return
  the new or edited row of the \code{\link{affiliations}()} \code{tibble}.

  \code{new_project()}, \code{new_author()}, \code{edit_project()},
  \code{edit_author()}, and the \code{delete_*()} functions
  \link[=invisible]{invisibly} return the row of the corresponding metadata
  \code{tibble} that was added/edited/deleted, although the contents of this
  row are printed as a side-effect along with the other relevant information
  where applicable (e.g., project authors, author affiliations, project file
  paths).

  \code{new_idea()} returns the \code{id}, \code{title}, and \code{status}
  columns of the newly created row of the \code{\link{projects}()}
  \code{tibble}.
}
\description{
These functions create, edit, or delete rows in the \code{\link{projects}()},
\code{\link{tasks}()}, \code{\link{authors}()}, and
\code{\link{affiliations}()} tables, which are stored in the \emph{.metadata}
subdirectory of the main \link[=projects_folder]{projects folder}.
}
\details{
\code{new_project()} copies the folder in the \emph{.templates} folder named
by the \code{template_name} argument into the
\link[=projects_folder]{projects folder}, giving it the name specified by the
\code{folder_name} argument. It then creates a line in the
\code{\link{projects}()} table for the newly created project, filling many of
its fields with the contents of corresponding arguments of this function. See
\code{\link{setup_projects}()} for more information on the \emph{.templates}
folder.

\code{delete_project()} deletes project folders and removes their line from
the \code{\link{projects}()} table.

The \code{edit_*()} functions and the other \code{new_*()} and
\code{delete_*()} functions only create or edit rows in the \emph{.metadata}
tables.

\code{new_idea()} is a convenience function for quickly creating projects in
the \code{"0: idea"} stage.

\code{finish()} is a shortcut for \code{edit_task(my_project, my_TID, done =
1)}
